## My R Learning Record during PACT-DS

### First Project
[Coding Data Organization](https://github.com/Git-SXQ6/R-Projects/tree/b197e0cba94375ac33f9626d737f677f1addc05e/PACT-DS/Coding_Data_Organization)

In this project, I explored how to use R to process data from various excel sheet, and organize them into a collective table.
I haven't figured out how to combine them into the existed table, as the format might be weird. But it saved great amount of time for me to copy and paste them one by one (Thanks to R!)

I believe that these code can be used in the future data collection as well, and I hope it can help other people who are doing psychology research.
